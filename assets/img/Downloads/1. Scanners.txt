1. Scanners 
	Yared, Taimoor, and Ogaga 

2. SRE TSG Bot
	Ariel, Eilon, and Sukanth 

Gap: 
- No business drivers 
- Strong project management skills 
- Strong dependency management skills 


Getting Breeze to prioritize our work 
	- DMS 
	- Feature requests 


Sync with Eilon: 
- More prescriptive updates on Stand-up, especially considering our PMs are not every technical 

- As we think about your growth, I want you to take more ownership of features and proactively come to that decision to work on, instead of waiting for Ariel or me to provide a list of items. 

- This is what's expected at the next level and I want us to think about what's needed to get there.
